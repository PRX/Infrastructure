# Generally this template is used to launch stacks from the bootstrapping
# CodePipeline. Primarily is is simply a wrapper around individial app- and
# service-specific templates, which get nested into this template and are
# launched when this one is. The CodePiple also passes in a template
# configuration file, which includes parameter values for this and all nested
# templates. This root template MUST define all parameters that are included in
# the config file. It can then pass along select values to nested stacks that
# require them.
