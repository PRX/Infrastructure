# cdn/single-origin.yml
# When creating a CloudFront distribution for an S3 bucket, it is recommended
# that the bucket remains private and CloudFront is given access to it via an
# Origin Access Identity. This template can create that identity, but it cannot
# update the origin bucket's policy to grant the identity access permissions.
# Once the stack has been created, add a policy like the following to the
# bucket. Be sure to replace the bucket name in the Resource, and change the
# object prefix to match only what CloudFront needs access to. Also replace
# the origin access identity, such as E15MNIMTCFKK4C, in the Principal. You can
# find that value in the stack outputs under CloudFrontOriginAccessIdentityId.

      comma-delimited list (e.g. "session_ID,user_ID"). The list should include
      only cookie names, but the full cookie (e.g. "session_ID=1234") will be
      sent to the origin, and included in the cache key.
  CloudFrontMinTtl:
    Type: String
    Description: >-
      (optional) The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that you want objects
      to stay in the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request
      to the origin to see if the object has been updated. The default value
      for this field is 0 seconds.
  CloudFrontMaxTtl:
    Type: String
    Description: >-
      (optional) The maximum amount of time, in seconds, that objects stay in
      the CloudFront cache before CloudFront sends another request to the
      origin to see if the object has been updated. CloudFront uses this value
      only when the origin sends Cache-Control or Expires headers with the
      object. The default value for this field is 31536000 seconds (one year).
      If the value of MinTTL or DefaultTTL is more than 31536000 seconds, then
      the default value for this field is the same as the value of DefaultTTL.

      distribution (http://www.example.com/index.html).
  CloudFrontAllowedMethods:
    Type: CommaDelimitedList

      distribution access to an S3 bucket via a bucket policy. Only use this

      bucket policies, but such a policy is required to allow the origin access
      identity to function properly.
