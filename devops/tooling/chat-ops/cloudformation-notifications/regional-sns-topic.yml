AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31
Description: >-
  Creates an SNS topic, which can be used as the notification topic for
  CloudFormation stacks in the same region. This template is intended to be
  launched in each region where we use CloudFormation, but only in the DevOps
  account; CloudFormation can publish notifications to topics across accounts,
  but not across regions. A single Lambda function in us-east-2 is intended to
  be subscribed to all topics launched from this template.

Parameters:
  OrganizationId: { Type: String }

Resources:
  CloudFormationNotificationsSnsTopic:
    Type: AWS::SNS::Topic
    # This SNS topic is retained to prevent clients that are configured to
    # publish to it from breaking if the stack gets torn down. In cases where
    # the stack is being moved or replaced, the retained topic should be
    # imported into the new stack, or the new subscriber should continue to
    # subscribe to this topic
