# devops/aws-management/organization-cloudtrail-bus-rules.yml
# This stack creates EventBridge rules. It does **not** create an EventBridge
# event bus.
#
# The rules are expected to exist on *all* default event buses within the AWS
# Organization. Event buses are regional, thus this stack is intended to be
# launched once for every region in every account within the organization.
#
# Not all regions support cross-region EventBridge rules, but as of 2024-04 all
# regions that we use do.
#
# These rules SHOULD NOT be added to any custom event buses we create; only
# default event buses.
#
# Thes rule will forward select CloudTrail activity events that reach the
# default bus to a *single* custom event bus in us-east-2 in the DevOps
# account. These events will often be sent cross-region and cross-account. Any
# CloudTrails activity must end up at that custom bus to be handled correctly.
#
# The definition for that bus can be found in
# devops/tooling/chat-ops/cloudtrail-toolkit/template.yml -> CloudTrailEventBus
