# devops/aws-management/oam-source-account-link.yml
# This stack, and the associated monitoring account stack, create links between
# various AWS accounts that allow for cross-account observability in CloudWatch.
# See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html
#
# This stack must be launched **after** the monitoring account stack, which
# creates the "sink". The "link" created in this stack is associated with that
# sink.
#
# This sink/link functionality is different than the cross-account CloudWatch
# features of the CloudWatch Console.
#
# The account where this stack is launch is intended to be the one whose data
# is _being monitored_ by another account.
