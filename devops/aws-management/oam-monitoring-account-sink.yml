# devops/aws-management/oam-monitoring-account-sink.yml
# This stack, and the associated source account stack, create links between
# various AWS accounts that allow for cross-account observability in CloudWatch.
# See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Unified-Cross-Account.html
#
# This stack must be launched **before** the source account stack, which
# creates the "link" to the "sink" that is created in this stack.
#
# This sink/link functionality is different than the cross-account CloudWatch
# features of the CloudWatch Console.
#
# The account where this stack is launch is intended to be the one monitoring
# CloudWatch data in other accounts.
