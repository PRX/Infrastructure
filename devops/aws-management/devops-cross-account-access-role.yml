# devops/aws-managements/devops-cross-account-access-role.yml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: "2010-09-09"
Description: >-
  Creates an IAM role that's intended to exist in each account within an AWS
  Organization. This role provides specific, consistent access to various
  resources and services within all accounts, so that they can be managed
  centrally. By default and convention, the role's name is:
  DevOps-CrossAccountAccessRole. This template is intended to be launched as
  part of a service-managed StackSet that automatically deploys to all accounts
  within an organization. Only needs to be launched once per account, since
  roles are global within an account.

Parameters:
  OrganizationId:
    Type: String
    Description: e.g. o-a1s2d3f4f5g
    AllowedPattern: ^(o-[a-z0-9]{4,32})$
  CrossAccountAccessRoleName:
    Type: String
    Default: DevOps-CrossAccountAccessRole
    Description: >-
      The name of cross-account access role. The default value is
      "DevOps-CrossAccountAccessRole", and generally that should be used so
      that it's predictable by other users and services.

# Creates a role with a known name, which will exist in all accounts within
# the AWS Organization. This role can also be assumed by any other role within
# the organization.
#
# Since we know the role will exist and can be assumed, we can use this role to
# perform some common tasks against all accounts within the organization,
# regardless of where those tasks are being performed or which IAM role is
# otherwise being used to perform them. (I.e., a Lambda function in any account,
# with any execution role, can assume this role and perform one of the allowed
# IAM actions.)
#
# IMPORTANT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
#
# The permissions given to this role through the actions and resources listed
# in the following IAM policies should only include EXTREMELY safe permissions.
# This role should never be used for CRUD operations of actual resources. It is
# intended for things like read-only Get and List operations on some resource
# types, or very safe maintenance tasks, like creating a CloudFront
# invalidation.
#
# New permissions should be added to this role very deliberately andjudiciously.
