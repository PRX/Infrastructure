name: Deploy Porter CD pipeline CloudFormation stacks

# This workflow updates the CloudFormations stacks that manage the continuous
# deployment pipelines for Porter. These pipelines exist in multiple regions,
# and this workflow updates all of them. This workflow is only intended to
# update **existing** stacks, not to launch new stacks.
#
# The stacks that this workflow interacts with are only for the deployment
# pipelines, **not** for Porter itself.
#
# tl;dr deploys devops/porter-cd-pipeline.yml
