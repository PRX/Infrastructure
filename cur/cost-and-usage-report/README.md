## Notes

- `product/ProductName` per [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/product-columns.html) _"Use this column to filter AWS usage by AWS service."_
- Some costs that appear on a bill as **Data Transfer** will show up in CUR under the product/service where the data transfer happened. For example, S3 costs in CUR for a given month are higher than the S3 line in the bill
- CloudFront private pricing does **not** have `product/ProductName`. It does have a `lineItem/ProductCode` of `AmazonCloudFront`, and `lineItem/LineItemType` of `PrivateRateDiscount`. These lines do not match 1-for-1 with any CloudFront cost lines, as best I can tell. They are broken out by account (though not all accounts that use CloudFront seem to be represented), and in at least one other way (not sure by what, I just see multiple lines per account per month). These lines also have `lineItem/UsageType` like `AU-DataTransfer-Out-Bytes`. They don't seem to report a rate anywhere. They don't seem to report a usage amount anywhere. They do have `pricing/RateCode` and `pricing/RateId` which seem meaningful, but I don't know what they mean. `RateId` seems to change every month.
